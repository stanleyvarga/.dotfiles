If I had to keep just one plugin, it would be `zoxide` or `zsh-z`, as they mostly have the same functionality.

Zoxide helps you quickly navigate your most visited directories, making it easy to jump around them with ease ðŸ¦˜.

```bash
# cd into ~/Documents/dev/some-project/frontend
z d fr 
# because it's fuzzy you can also use
z sp f `or` z s f
```

You can see that `Warp` understood the mispelling and tried to help me out (`Insert suggested command: git add --all`), but there is no cursing involved. Pass ðŸ¤¬ !
