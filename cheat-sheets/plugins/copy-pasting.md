## Copy, paste, safely

Often you need to copy some file, maybe copy it to clipboard or just move it around your filesystem. For that I use some helpful plugins

### copypath

ðŸ”— [copypath](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/copypath)

Usage:

- `copypath`: copies the absolute path of the current directory.
- `copypath <file_or_directory>`: copies the absolute path of the given file.

### copyfile

ðŸ”— [copyfile](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/copyfile)

Puts the contents of a file in your system **clipboard** ðŸ“‹ so you can paste it anywhere.

`copyfile <filename>` to copy the file named `filename`.

### safe-paste

Since I'm using Warp, I don't use this plugin now
