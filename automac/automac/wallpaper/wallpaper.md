## Ideas

- I could make a config property called `wallpaper`, that would simply be set to a wallpaper path. Then, I would only set this one wallpaper for both screens, or more. I think it's cleaner way, than do it like I do it. The reason for this wild solution is I did this in JS and was only testing this shit
