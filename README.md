## `.dotfiles`

Ballad of `Dotfileschantment`

>In a land where *nix reigns supreme,  
>A tale unfolds, a geek's daydream,  
>Of .dotfiles vast and secrets deep,  
>Where coders toil while others sleep.  
>
>The .vimrc, a sacred scroll,  
>With mappings, macros, and control,  
>They tweak and twiddle, line by line,  
>To craft a setup so divine.  
>
>Yet IDEs, with ease and grace,  
>Lie just a click from their embrace,  
>But nay, the .dotfile's siren call,  
>Draws them back, enthralls them all. 
>
>A zsh prompt, so sleek, so neat,  
>They script it 'til it's obsolete,  
>Weeks have passed, in screen’s soft light,  
>In search of settings just so right.  
>
>For hours lost in config bliss,  
>They chase a dream they can't dismiss,  
>Of systems perfect, finely tuned,  
>Yet practical? Perhaps lampooned.  
>
>So here's a toast to .dotfile lore,  
>To hours spent, and configs more,  
>In endless loops they tweak and twine,  
>Their systems perfect, by design.  
>
>But as the sun sets, and moonlight beams,  
>They wake up from the config dreams,  
>And wonder, with a wistful sigh,  
>Was all that tweaking worth the while?
